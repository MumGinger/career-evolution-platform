# Current State

**Phase:** Capability 003.6 Candidate Knowledge Integration implemented
**Last updated:** 2026-08-03

## Completed

- Established project foundation and working agreement.
- Documented the product-first vision, architecture principles, and initial design models.
- Recorded the decision to validate Career before extracting a framework.
- Implemented MVP-001: a local application-to-interview evidence loop with SQLite persistence, versioned artifacts, and non-learning outcome evidence.
- Implemented Experiment 002: PDF resume intake that bootstraps traceable Candidate Knowledge facts without inferred content.
- Implemented Capability 003.1: deterministic, versioned Job Intelligence profiles with immutable job-description snapshots, requirement excerpts, policy rationale, and parser/policy metadata.
- Implemented Capability 003.2: deterministic, persisted, immutable Information Need prioritization runs that retain the job-profile version, candidate-evidence snapshot, policy inputs, evidence references, uncertainty, and rationale.
- Implemented Capability 003.3: deterministic local Evidence Discovery Runs that search bounded snapshot sources, retain candidate provenance and resolutions, stop when evidence is sufficient, and leave unresolved needs without asking a user or updating Candidate Knowledge.
- Redefined the remaining Capability 003 sequence: 003.4 is Acquisition Planning, 003.5 is Acquisition Execution, and 003.6 is Candidate Knowledge Integration.
- Implemented Capability 003.4: deterministic, immutable Acquisition Plan Runs with first-class plans, separate actions, explainable gain-versus-cost rationales, and grouping of compatible unresolved needs under shared actions.
- Implemented Capability 003.5: deterministic local Acquisition Execution with immutable Acquisition Result Runs, first-class per-action results, raw evidence capture, provenance, timestamps, and independent re-runs for the same plan.

## Current focus

Review deterministic Acquisition Execution outcome vocabulary, local capture ergonomics, and the future authorization/consent boundary before adding non-local adapters.

## Next decision

Define Capability 003.6 Candidate Knowledge Integration: evidence resolution, acceptance thresholds, conflict handling, and auditable durable-write decisions.

## Open questions

- What evidence sources are useful, consented, and ethically appropriate beyond local user-entered data?
- What makes available evidence sufficient for each bounded artifact or decision?
- Which recovery actions should be available before a user request, and how should their privacy cost be compared?
- What confirmation and conflict threshold must Candidate Knowledge Integration meet before it accepts a fact?
- What review authority and corroboration threshold are required before outcome evidence changes a priority or skill?
